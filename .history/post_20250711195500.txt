Thrilled to unveil a recent project we had the chance to work on —
A full-fledged website designed and built for Paul Delta Arc, a Kolkata-based company offering Mechanical-Electrical-Plumbing (MEP) services across India. 💼✨
🔗 pauldeltaarc.com

From concept to deployment, we poured care into the UI, interactions, layout balance, and the overall brand feel.
👨‍💻 Built using Next.js + TailwindCSS, this site challenged us to:
Keep things performance-friendly without compromising on aesthetic polish
Handle mobile responsiveness across complex grid layouts & hover effects
Maintain visual clarity despite info-heavy sections
Use subtle animations that enhance, not distract

🎨 Some of our favorite design moments:
Gradient backgrounds and icon-led service tiles
Floating effects and micro-interactions
Custom navbar

🤝 A joint effort by Anupriya Biswas and Suman Prasad — shaping both the visuals and the functionality behind the screen.
